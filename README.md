I made this app because my father, who has passed, was a crypto trader, and when I inherited his pc, there were dozens of seeds but with no identification. I knew he had currencies as he told me he had, I just didn't know how to find them. 

This app uses bip_utils and covers every currency offered by bip_utils, including many more.

Using this app, we discovered that many wallet apps give air-drops according to your seed, and if you don't catch the email or alert, you might never know of a currency tied to your wallet.

Several of the currencies require deposits before an address is activated, so if you see an error but a valid seed, its because the address wasn't yet activated. 

Also, try to key the number of addresses generated below 10 so the api key's do not get banned. 10 should be plenty.

If this app helps you in anyway, consider donating to help in the creation of new tools.
